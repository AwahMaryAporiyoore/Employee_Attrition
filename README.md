# DATA EXPLORATION ON EMPLOYEE ATTRITION 
## by Awah Mary Aporiyoore


## Dataset

The chosen dataset for this project is the "Employee Attrition" dataset which was obtained from kaggle.com. 

This dataset includes information about employees within a specific department, their educational fields, their total working years, total working hours, attrition among others.

Before Exploring the data, various data wrangling processes were taken place. They include:
1. Identifying null values: the dataset was without NaN values
2. Identifying duplicates: The dataset was without duplicates
3. Identifying Naming Conventions/conflictions: Every column had accurate names


## Summary of Findings
The intial aim for undertaking this project was to identify the major causes for high attrition rate within an organization.

Based on the dataset, it was identified that the attrition rate within this organization was lower than expected.

Withinn the dataset were males and females all working within a specific department - Research and Development, Sales and Human Resources.

Out of these male and females were married couples, singles and divorced.

Various factors could cause an employee to leave an organization. The factors that was considered includes: Monthly Income, Employee Involvement, Job Satisfaction, Relationship Satisfaction and Performance Ratings.

The findings within this notebook shows that employees with Yes as their attrition has: Lower Performance Ratings, Lower Income and Lower Job Involvement.

Per Departments, employee relationship satisfaction is higher and/or close to equal between employees with Yes and No as their attrition.


## Key Insights for Presentation

The criteria for the presentation is to analyse the data against the Attrition Count, Attrition Per Gender, Performance Rating, Job Involvement, Monthly Income and Relationship Satisfaction.

In the end, the visualizations will highlight the following:

Some probable causes of Employee Attrition is: Monthly Income, Performance Rating, Realationship Satisfaction, Distance from home and Job Involvement. 

It was quite suprising to find that Relationship Satisfaction was not one of the cause of employee Attrition.


I am assuming that employees with low performance rating and job involvement could have been laid off.
